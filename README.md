📈 Time Series Forecasting: Sensor Count
This project focuses on forecasting sensor count over time using a combination of classical machine learning models and deep learning techniques.

📌 Objective
To predict future sensor activity based on historical time series data, helping understand trends, anomalies, and system behavior over time.

🧠 Models Implemented
Linear Regression – a simple baseline for comparison

Random Forest Regressor – a robust ensemble model

XGBoost Regressor – gradient boosting-based model known for performance

LSTM – deep learning model designed for sequence prediction

🔁 Workflow Overview
1. Data Preprocessing
Time formatting and resampling

Feature engineering (lags)

2. Model Training
Train-test split based on time

Sequence preparation for LSTM (windowing)

3. Evaluation
Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R²

Visualization: actual vs predicted sensor counts

Comparison across models

4. Forecasting
